	  The tpm2-tss-engine project implements a cryptographic engine for
	  OpenSSL for Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0) using the tpm2-tss
	  software stack that follows the Trusted Computing Groups (TCG)
	  TPM Software Stack (TSS 2.0). It uses the Enhanced System API (ESAPI)
	  interface of the TSS 2.0 for downwards communication. It supports
	  RSA decryption and signatures as well as ECDSA signatures.
